### ConnectivityC2C3:
Plots the counts of pre- and post-synaptic contacts for C2 and C3 extracted from neuPRINT explorer medulla7coulmn dataset (Clements et al., 2020) (**Fig.2**) 

### Plot_ONOFF_FlashAnalysis_5sec_T4T5_CA_BG_sub_SIMA_gh:
Analyzes T4T5 responses to a full field ON/OFF stimulus for control and C2, C3 and C2C3 double silencing conditions  (**Fig.3a,b,c** and **Suppl.Fig. 2** )

### Plot_ONOFF_FlashAnalysis_5sec_C2_C3_gh:
Plots C2 and C3 responses to a full field ON/OFF stimulus (**Fig.5a** and **Suppl.Fig.5**)

### read_npy_RFData_to_Mat_gh:
Analyzes T4T5 STRFs that were extracted using Python (**Fig.3d-j** and **Suppl.Fig. 3** )

### read_npy_RFData_to_Mat_C2C3:
Analyzes T4T5 STRFs that were extracted using Python (**Fig.5c-e**)

### explore_CA_DATA_DriftingStripes_Polarplots_Kir_C2C3_gh:
Analyzes T4T5 direction selectivity from responses to drifting stripes moving into 8 different directions (**Fig.4** and **Suppl.Fig. 4** )

### explore_8dirEdges_Polarplots_C2C3_mh_gh:
Analyzes C2and C3 direction selectivity from responses to drifting stripes moving into 8 different directions (**Fig.5b**)
